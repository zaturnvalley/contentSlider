        Vaporwave is an electronic music subgenre that originated during the early 2010s and spread over the next half of the decade among various Internet communities. It is characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist fascination with entertainment, technology and advertising (particularly of the 1980s and 1990s), and styles of both corporate and popular music such as lounge music, smooth jazz and elevator music. Artists often embrace classical sculpture, web design, capitalism, low-poly computer renderings, glitch art, VHS recordings, cassette tapes, Japanese art and cyberpunk tropes. Sampling is prevalent within the genre, with samples often pitched down, layered or altered (earlier in a classic chopped and screwed style).

      <li class="a">

        Many have interpreted vaporwave music as a critique or reflection on consumer capitalism and popular culture, as its name alludes to vaporware, a term for products that are announced but never released. The visual style of vaporwave (as seen on album covers and music videos) is commonly referred to as aesthetics (often stylized as "ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ", with fullwidth characters).

      <li class="a">

        Vaporwave originated as an Internet-birthed style loosely derived from the work of hypnagogic pop artists such as Ariel Pink and James Ferraro.Daniel Lopatin's 2010 release Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1, Ferraro's Far Side Virtual and Vektroid's Floral Shoppe are often credited for sparking the beginning and development of the trend, as well as solidifying it as a genre. Vaporwave found wider appeal in 2012, with the release of Blank Banshee's debut studio album Blank Banshee 0, which introduced his signature fusion style of vaporwave's sampling techniques and trap music known as vaportrap.

        A 2015 Rolling Stone list included vaporwave act 2814 as one of "10 artists you need to know", citing their album Atarashii Hi no Tanjō (新しい日の誕生?, "Birth of a New Day"). That same year, the album I'll Try Living Like This by Death's Dynamic Shroud.wmv was featured at number fifteen on the Fact list "The 50 Best Albums of 2015".
